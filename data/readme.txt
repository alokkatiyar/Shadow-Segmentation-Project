Entire dataset is too large to include in "Final_Project" folder.

So, we are including in this folder instance of each type of file that we used for our project.

1) "zhu-003.jpg" - image 

2) "zhu-003.xml" - This xml file contains only the shadow pixel coordinates of the zhu-003.jpg image. This file was provided with the dataset.

3) "zhu-003_shadow_coordinates.txt" - this txt file contains only shadow edge pixel coordinates that we extracted from the zhu-003.xml file.

4) "zhu-003_features.txt" - This txt file contains all the edge pixel coordinates along with their cooresponding 36 features. 
   This file is formatted as below:
   first 36 values are the 36D features and next two values are y and x coordinates of the image respectively.  	

Entire dataset consists of 135 images(.jpg) and their corresponding 3 files for each image (i.e. ".xml", "*_shadow_coordinates.txt", "*_features.txt").
